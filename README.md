### React Blog

This is a simple react & redux blog that uses just state to manage the list of blogs. The data is not persistent since it is not coming from any database.

### `npm install`

To install all the dependencies use this command.

### `npm start`

To start the dev server use this command.

### Contributions

This project has been started by with the intention of it being and Open Source program where beginners in react can come
and pitch their ideas to make it better. You can add features, add CSS to make it look better (currently semantic ui is used).

### Further Ideas

Now that Redux has been integrated , the next step can be to convert it into a full blown rest api 
blog, with a backend server. We can use a simple json-server or we can use an express server as well.
Any contributors are welcome!
